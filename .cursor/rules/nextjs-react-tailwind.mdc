- Use Next.js App Router structure (`app/.../page.tsx`)
- Mark interactive components with `'use client'` only as needed, wrap in `Suspense`
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use PascalCase for component files and kebab-case for directories
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, adhering to our design system tokens
- Avoid unnecessary state hooks; prefer server components and React Server Actions
