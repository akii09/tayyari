# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a comprehensive multi-AI provider system with advanced context and memory management for the learning platform. The system will support multiple AI providers (Ollama, Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, Mistral) through AI-SDK integration, enable users to learn multiple concepts simultaneously, and provide intelligent context-aware tutoring with persistent memory across learning sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-AI Provider Integration

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to integrate multiple AI providers so that users can choose their preferred AI model and the platform has fallback options for reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL support connections to Ollama, Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, and Mistral APIs
2. WHEN a user selects an AI provider THEN the system SHALL use AI-SDK to manage the connection and requests
3. WHEN an AI provider fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to the next available provider
4. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting and error responses gracefully
5. IF a provider requires API keys THEN the system SHALL securely store and manage authentication credentials

### Requirement 2: Multiple Learning Concept Support

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to pursue multiple learning concepts simultaneously so that I can have a diverse learning experience and switch between topics based on my mood and availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes onboarding THEN they SHALL be able to select multiple learning concepts
2. WHEN a user has multiple active concepts THEN the system SHALL maintain separate progress tracking for each
3. WHEN a user switches between concepts THEN the AI SHALL load the appropriate context for that specific learning path
4. WHEN generating plans THEN the system SHALL create customized learning plans for each selected concept
5. IF a user wants to add new concepts THEN they SHALL be able to do so without affecting existing progress

### Requirement 3: Advanced Context and Memory Management

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the AI tutor to remember our previous conversations and my learning progress so that each session builds upon previous knowledge and feels personalized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a learning session THEN the AI SHALL have access to their complete learning history for that concept
2. WHEN the AI generates responses THEN it SHALL consider the user's learning style, pace, and previous interactions
3. WHEN a conversation exceeds token limits THEN the system SHALL intelligently summarize and compress context while preserving key information
4. WHEN a user returns after a break THEN the AI SHALL provide a brief recap of where they left off
5. IF the user asks about previous topics THEN the AI SHALL reference specific past conversations and progress

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Onboarding Experience

**User Story:** As a new user, I want a flexible onboarding process that allows me to customize my learning journey and skip or modify steps based on my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts onboarding THEN they SHALL be able to skip concept selection and add concepts later
2. WHEN a user selects learning concepts THEN the system SHALL generate personalized plans using their profile information
3. WHEN generating plans THEN the AI SHALL consider user's available time, learning goals, and preferred learning style
4. WHEN a user wants to modify their plan THEN they SHALL be able to customize duration, intensity, and focus areas
5. IF a user has prior knowledge THEN they SHALL be able to indicate their skill level for more accurate plan generation

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Context Storage and Retrieval

**User Story:** As a system, I need to efficiently store and retrieve user context so that AI interactions remain fast and relevant while managing storage costs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing conversation history THEN the system SHALL use vector embeddings for semantic search capabilities
2. WHEN retrieving context THEN the system SHALL prioritize recent and relevant information based on the current topic
3. WHEN context grows large THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent pruning strategies to maintain performance
4. WHEN a user has multiple concepts THEN the system SHALL maintain separate context stores with cross-referencing capabilities
5. IF storage limits are approached THEN the system SHALL archive older context while preserving key milestones and achievements

### Requirement 6: AI Provider Configuration and Management

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to configure and manage AI providers dynamically so that I can optimize costs, performance, and user experience without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring providers THEN administrators SHALL be able to set priority orders, rate limits, and cost thresholds
2. WHEN a provider becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically route requests to alternative providers
3. WHEN monitoring usage THEN administrators SHALL have access to analytics on provider performance, costs, and user preferences
4. WHEN updating configurations THEN changes SHALL take effect without requiring system restarts
5. IF cost thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement usage controls and notifications

### Requirement 7: Personalized Learning Plan Generation

**User Story:** As a learner, I want AI-generated learning plans that adapt to my progress and preferences so that my learning experience remains engaging and effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a plan THEN the AI SHALL use user profile data, learning history, and selected concepts
2. WHEN a user makes progress THEN the plan SHALL automatically adjust difficulty and pacing
3. WHEN a user struggles with topics THEN the AI SHALL provide additional resources and alternative explanations
4. WHEN a user excels THEN the system SHALL offer advanced topics and accelerated paths
5. IF a user's schedule changes THEN the plan SHALL adapt to new time constraints and availability

### Requirement 8: Cross-Concept Learning Integration

**User Story:** As a learner with multiple active concepts, I want the AI to identify and highlight connections between different subjects so that I can build a more comprehensive understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning multiple concepts THEN the AI SHALL identify and suggest connections between related topics
2. WHEN explaining concepts THEN the AI SHALL reference knowledge from other active learning paths when relevant
3. WHEN a user completes milestones THEN the system SHALL update related concept contexts with new knowledge
4. WHEN generating practice exercises THEN the AI SHALL create interdisciplinary problems when appropriate
5. IF concepts have prerequisites THEN the system SHALL suggest optimal learning sequences across multiple subjects
