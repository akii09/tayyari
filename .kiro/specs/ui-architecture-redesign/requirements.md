# UI Architecture Redesign Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical UI layout issues and AI provider integration problems in the TayyarAI chat interface. The current implementation has broken layouts, overlapping elements, improper positioning, and AI providers defaulting to fallback responses instead of using configured providers like Gemini.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Layout Architecture

**User Story:** As a user, I want a properly structured chat interface with consistent layout behavior, so that I can interact with the AI without UI elements overlapping or breaking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat page loads THEN the layout SHALL use a proper flex-based structure with defined containers
2. WHEN the sidebar is toggled THEN it SHALL slide in/out smoothly without affecting main content positioning
3. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL be responsive with proper touch targets
4. WHEN the header is displayed THEN it SHALL remain sticky at the top without overlapping content
5. WHEN messages are displayed THEN they SHALL scroll properly within their container
6. WHEN the input area is shown THEN it SHALL remain fixed at the bottom without covering messages

### Requirement 2: Component Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean component hierarchy with proper separation of concerns, so that the UI is maintainable and follows React best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are structured THEN they SHALL follow a clear hierarchy: Layout > Header/Sidebar/Main > Content
2. WHEN state is managed THEN it SHALL be properly lifted to appropriate parent components
3. WHEN props are passed THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript interfaces
4. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL use consistent styling patterns
5. WHEN accessibility is considered THEN components SHALL include proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Requirement 3: AI Provider Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use configured AI providers like Gemini instead of fallback responses, so that I get proper AI assistance for my learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI provider is configured THEN the system SHALL use that provider instead of fallback
2. WHEN Gemini is healthy THEN it SHALL be selected as the active provider
3. WHEN provider health is checked THEN the status SHALL be accurately displayed in the UI
4. WHEN a message is sent THEN it SHALL route to the selected provider correctly
5. WHEN provider switching occurs THEN the UI SHALL update to reflect the current provider
6. IF a provider fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback with clear error messaging

### Requirement 4: Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the interface to work properly on desktop, tablet, and mobile, so that I can learn effectively regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the sidebar SHALL be visible by default with proper width
2. WHEN viewing on tablet THEN the sidebar SHALL be collapsible with overlay behavior
3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the sidebar SHALL be hidden by default and slide over content
4. WHEN touch interactions occur THEN they SHALL have appropriate target sizes (44px minimum)
5. WHEN text is displayed THEN it SHALL scale appropriately for different screen sizes

### Requirement 5: Performance and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the interface to be performant and accessible, so that I can use assistive technologies effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN animations are enabled THEN they SHALL respect user's motion preferences
2. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN all interactive elements SHALL be focusable
3. WHEN screen readers are used THEN content SHALL be properly announced
4. WHEN high contrast mode is enabled THEN the interface SHALL maintain readability
5. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL not cause layout shifts or performance issues

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when things are loading or when errors occur, so that I understand the system state and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI providers are loading THEN appropriate loading indicators SHALL be shown
2. WHEN provider health checks fail THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN messages are being processed THEN typing indicators SHALL be shown
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN retry options SHALL be provided
5. WHEN fallback mode is active THEN users SHALL be notified with configuration guidance
